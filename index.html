it´s common knowledge that you absolutely do not care the spaces you invade, in fact you´ll be calling it anything else but its violent name.
a big part of this problem is the apathy that you take this matter with, everytime you say, express, condole that this is a great place to live cause its cheap
you generate intrest in housing prices and creating a demand for them, demand that caughts the eye of one of the worst parasites we encounter in modern days:
the cartel inmobiliario, upon what you think and the prejudices you have, you coexist with the heads of this organizations cause they look just like you.

        <p>THIS IS YOU, THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE, WHAT YOU DO "nomadas digitales"
for a home to be ready for your arrival there must be a family that has to be evicted from their history, culture and context in the most violent and irregular way posible,
it doesn´t stops there, not only its generated a displacement, a higher fee in all services gets involved, along priority shopping and musts, and the worst of them is that housing
becomes a service and stops being a HUMAN RIGHT, with prices so elevated you need to give 75% of your fortnightly income only in rent, making it impossible to fight back.

        <p>it ain´t too late to be a better person, i´m not demanding you to leave, i only ask for a real sense of community, if you really want to be here, to be part of this space and it´s dynamics, get to know and RESPECT your surrowndings, the only good way of using privileges its doing them in a good cause, like helping the people that got despojada or cutting your indirect ties with the cartel inmobiliario, to make the space we all share a little better, this is my last effort of being kind, no more english in territorio mexicano, no tienes idea del mar de oportunidades laborales que perdemos en nuestro propio país por no saber tu idioma, por darte el puto gusto.</p>
